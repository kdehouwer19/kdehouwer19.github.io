        <h1>Catmom</h1>
        <p>I'm a real catmom. Our cat's name is Loulou. <br>Our friends call me a crazy cat lady.</p>
        
        <h1>Previous work experience</h1>
        <p>I worked 5 years as a Travel Agent for the Belgian company Connections. I love to travel, explore and experience new places in the world.<br> I have gained some nice travel experiences at my time there.</p>
        <p>Due to Covid-19, I changed my course to software. I started in 2021 at a small software company, Climapulse. Climapulse creates software for the HVAC Industry. <br>I was part of the product team, so I functioned as a connection between the software and the clients.</p>
        
        <h1>Why the switch?</h1>
        <p>I have always had an interest in coding. At Climapulse, I worked with tools like GitHub, VS Code, Productboard, but this was more to manage/oversee the software and roadmap. So I took a online class on Codecademy to learn to code. And now I'm here.</p>
